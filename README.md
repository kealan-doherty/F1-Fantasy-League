Welcome to my verison of F1 Fantasy. which is a padory off the offical F1 Fantasy app. 

    Tech Stack used: 
                    JavaSctipt
                    Express.js,
                    Postgres,
                    CSS/HTML

In this web application you will be able to create your team of 2 current F1 drivers and 1 cosntuctor and play for points to see how can create the ulitmate F1 dream team. 


Current Status: 

              Users are now able to see their current team line up upon signing into their account.
              They are also now able to update their teams and how there changes show up in the Profile Page
              


Next steps: 

            Route new users to a page where they are able to select their intial team. 
            also to find a F1 API to pull Qualifying, Overtakes, and Finishing Position Data 
            to Update their points. 

            Also make more updates to UI and styling to provide a cleaner more professional look!
