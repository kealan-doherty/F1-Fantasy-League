        <h2 class="how">How It Works:</h2>
        <p>Each race weekend, you'll have until the end of Free Practice 1 on Friday to select your lineup. Points are awarded on Saturday for Qualifying performance:</p>

        <div class="container">
            <ul class="qualiList">
                <li>Pole Position: 10 pts</li>
                <li>P2: 9 pts</li>
                <li>P3: 6 pts</li>
                <li>P4: 3 pts</li>
                <li>P5: 1 pt</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="description">On Sunday, you'll receive points based on your constructor's performance (highest finishing driver), the number of overtakes your drivers make (2 points per overtake), and your drivers' finishing positions (points awarded as in the actual race).
